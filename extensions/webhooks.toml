# `handle` will be injected by Shopify CLI when you run `shopify app dev`

# This file is a placeholder so we have an extension ready when we start
# subscribing to Shopify order events (for example `orders/create`).
# Once the webhook route exists, uncomment the block below and run
# `shopify app deploy` to register it.
